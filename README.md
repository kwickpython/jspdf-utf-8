# jspdf-utf-8
embedded fonts for client side PDF(pdfkit, jspdf..), UTF8 encode, multibyte characters language, chinese...

Not really a embedded solution, but gets the job done much faster.

Loading a giant font matrixs is not fun. Our goal is to using the client machine to its maximum, not to wasting our bandwidth.

So, with this add on, we can have client computer build all the required fonts, keep them in session storage.
